# Brief Description
I am a [PhD student](https://daedalus.berlin/people/alessandro-borghi/) in the group FG Modellierung, Simulation und Optimierung realer Prozesse of [Prof. Dr. Tobias Breiten](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/?id=214242). My position is given by the [DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/) group. 
The topic of my project deals with the design and implementation of efficient algorithms for solving (parametric) nonlinear eigenvalue problems. <!--In particular we are interested on nonlinear eigenvalue problems and the identification of _exceptional points_.-->
My research has connections with _numerical linear algebra_, _data-driven model order reduction_, _control theory_, and _approximation theory_. 

<!--My research focuses on the design and implementation of algorithms for solving nonlinar eigenvalue problems. In particular I am interested on the identification of _exceptional points_. -->


# Education
- **PhD Researcher** at TU Berlin / Institut für Mathematik, [member of DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/people/alessandro-borghi/#personal-impressiond6c2-33510307-0da2) <br/>(Berlin, Germany) <br/>[Oct.2021-Present]
- **MSc Systems & Control** at Delft University of Technology / 3mE Department / DCSC <br/>(Delft, Netherlands) <br/>[Sep.2019-Oct.2021]
- **BSc Automation Engineering** for double bachelor program with Tongji University <br/>(Shanghai, China) <br/>[Sep. 2016-Jul.2019]
- **BSc Automation Engineering** at University of Bologna <br/>(Bologna, Italy) <br/>[Sep. 2015-Dec.2018]

# Research Projects
- **PhD Research**: _"Structure-preserving model reduction for the efficient computation of exceptional points in thermoacoustic spectra"_ [Project](https://daedalus.berlin/projects/) of [DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/)
- **MSc Thesis Topic**: [_"Koopman Subspace Identification in the Presence of Measurement Noise"_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:22250d5c-875c-44a9-adf4-d643a6a08dba?collection=education) (see also [here](https://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~swahls/msc.html))<br/> The project dealt with computing a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator from noisy training data. For this purpose we developed a robust subspace-identification-based data-driven modeling technique.
- **Second BSc Thesis at Beckhoff Automation**: [_"Simulation and Implementation of the Input Shaping Technique for a Flexible Transmission System"_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357827921_Simulation_and_Implementation_of_the_Input_Shaping_Technique_for_a_Flexible_Transmission_System): <br/>
In this project we simulated the input shaping technique for a flexible transmission system using MATLAB for residual vibration cancellation. The algorithm was then implemented in TwinCAT for a real test scenario. Here a PLC would control an electric motor connected to a recirculating ball screw which would move a beam with a mass on top.
- **BSc Thesis**: _"Comparison of Three Fuzzy Controllers for an Industrial Linear Axis"_: <br/> Here we compared three fuzzy logic controllers applied to an AC Brushless motor attached to a recirculating ball screw. The controllers were designed in Simulink and applied to the electric drives through TwinCAT. These controllers would then be applied to the six axes of a Gough-Stewart platform for in vitro tests on human joints.
