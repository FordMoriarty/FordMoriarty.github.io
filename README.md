I am a PhD student in the group FG Modellierung, Simulation und Optimierung realer Prozesse of [Prof. Dr. Tobias Breiten](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/?id=214242). My position is given by the [DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/) group. 
The topic of my project deals with the design and implementation of efficient algorithms for solving eigenvalues problems. In particular we are interested on nonlinear eigenvalue problems and the identification of _exceptional points_.
My research has connections with numerical linear algebra, model order reduction, control theory, approximation theory, and perturbation theory.

# Education
- [**PhD Researcher**](https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_modnumdiff/fg_breiten/v_menue/mitarbeiterinnen/alessandro_borghi/home/) at TU Berlin / Institut für Mathematik  <br/>(Berlin, Germany) <br/>[Oct.2021-Present]
- **MSc Systems & Control** at Delft University of Technology / 3mE Department / DCSC <br/>(Delft, Netherlands) <br/>[Sep.2019-Oct.2021]
- **BSc Automation Engineering** for double bachelor program with Tongji University <br/>(Shanghai, China) <br/>[Sep. 2016-Jul.2019]
- **BSc Automation Engineering** at University of Bologna <br/>(Bologna, Italy) <br/>[Sep. 2015-Dec.2018]

# Research Projects
- **PhD Research**: _"Structure-preserving model reduction for the efficient computation of exceptional points in thermoacoustic spectra"_ [Project](https://daedalus.berlin/projects/) of [DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/)
- **MSc Thesis Topic**: [_"Koopman Subspace Identification in the Presence of Measurement Noise"_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:22250d5c-875c-44a9-adf4-d643a6a08dba?collection=education): <br/> Computing a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator through a subspace-identification-based data-driven modeling technique robust to measurement noise in the training data.
- **Second BSc Thesis at Beckhoff Automation**: [_"Simulation and Implementation of the Input Shaping Technique for a Flexible Transmission System"_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357827921_Simulation_and_Implementation_of_the_Input_Shaping_Technique_for_a_Flexible_Transmission_System): <br/>
Simulation of the input shaping technique for a flexible transmission system using MATLAB for residual vibration cancellation. The program was then implemented in TwinCAT for a real test demo, where a PLC would control an electric motor connected to a recirculating ball screw. This would move a flexible beam with, attached at the top, an arbitrary mass.
- **BSc Thesis**: _"Comparison of Three Fuzzy Controllers for an Industrial Linear Axis"_: <br/> Comparison of three fuzzy controllers, designed in Simulink, applied to an AC Brushless motor attached to a recirculating ball
screw. These controllers will then be applied
to the six axes of a Gough-Stewart platform
for in vitro tests in human joints.
