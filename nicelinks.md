## For Academics
_"You need to talk to people!"_. This was an advice given me twice at the start of my PhD. Well I did it. In the following there are some interesting links that I got by talking to people:

- A very nice website for interesting math topics is the [blog of Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/). In particular I would point out the section for [career advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)
- This [website](https://castel.dev/) is the homepage of Gilles Castel, a mathematics PhD student at KU Leuven specializing in $$\LaTeX$$ black magic.
- If you want to know who supervised your supervisor check out the [mathematical genealogical tree](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/index.php)
- Another interesting blog is the one from Nick Trefethen which got my attention thanks to [this page](https://trefethen.net/2018/12/06/advice-for-an-applied-math-talk/)  
- I find some good reads in this [webpage](https://www.lesswrong.com/)
- A very good summary of theoretical pillars in numerical linear algebra can be found in the website of [Nick Higham](https://nhigham.com/2022/05/18/the-big-six-matrix-factorizations/)
- For those of you interested in model order reduction, there is a very well designed Python library called [pyMOR](https://pymor.org/). For more information, and if you want to meet the developers, check out the yearly [pyMOR school](https://2022.school.pymor.org/)
