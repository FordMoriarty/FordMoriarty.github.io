# For Academics
- A very nice website for interesting math topics is the [blog of Terence Tao](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/). In particular I would point out the section for [career advice](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)
- This [website](https://castel.dev/) is the homepage of Gilles Castel, a mathematics PhD student at KU Leuven specializing in $\LaTeX$ black magic.
- If you want to who supervised your supervisor check out the [mathematical genealogical tree](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/index.php)
- Another interesting blog is the one from Nick Trefethen which got my attention thanks to [this page](https://trefethen.net/2018/12/06/advice-for-an-applied-math-talk/)
