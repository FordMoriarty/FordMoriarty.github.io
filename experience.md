# Research projects
- **PhD research**: _"Structure-preserving model reduction for the efficient computation of exceptional points in thermoacoustic spectra"_ [Project](https://daedalus.berlin/projects/) of [DAEDALUS](https://daedalus.berlin/)
- **MSc thesis topic**: [_"Koopman subspace identification in the presence of measurement noise"_](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:22250d5c-875c-44a9-adf4-d643a6a08dba?collection=education) (see also [here](https://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/~swahls/msc.html))<br/> The project dealt with computing a matrix approximation of the Koopman operator from noisy training data. For this purpose we developed a robust subspace-identification-based data-driven modeling technique.
- **second BSc thesis at Beckhoff automation**: [_"Simulation and implementation of the input shaping technique for a flexible transmission system"_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357827921_Simulation_and_Implementation_of_the_Input_Shaping_Technique_for_a_Flexible_Transmission_System): <br/>
In this project we simulated the input shaping technique for a flexible transmission system using MATLAB for residual vibration cancellation. The algorithm was then implemented in TwinCAT for a real test scenario. Here a PLC would control an electric motor connected to a recirculating ball screw which would move a beam with a mass on top.
- **BSc thesis**: _"Comparison of three fuzzy controllers for an industrial linear Aaxis"_: <br/> Here we compared three fuzzy logic controllers applied to an AC Brushless motor attached to a recirculating ball screw. The controllers were designed in Simulink and applied to the electric drives through TwinCAT. These controllers would then be applied to the six axes of a Gough-Stewart platform for in vitro tests on human joints.


# Professional experience
